After a series of expriments, they've found a way to quickly travel between different parts of this world, using <a href=\"handbook://block-tprunes:rune_beacon-andesite-copper\">Beacons</a> and <a href=\"handbook://item-tprunes:rune_stone-copper\">Rune Stones</a>.<br><br><br><font size=\"16\" weight=\"bold\" lineheight=\"1.2\">Usage</font><br>1. Create a <a href=\"handbook://block-tprunes:rune_beacon-andesite-copper\">Beacon</a><br>2. Place beacon on the place - to which you want to teleport (at least one of the sides should be not blocked).<br>3. Craft <a href=\"handbook://item-tprunes:raw_rune_stone-copper\">Raw Rune Stone</a> (chosen metal affects how many times you will be able to telport, to which distance)<br>4. Brun Raw Rune Stone in the fire pit to transform it to \"finished\" version of <a href=\"handbook://item-tprunes:rune_stone-copper\">Rune Stone</a><br>5. Holding Rune Stone in the right hand - right-click on the beacon, to bind it (and choose teleport destination name)<br>6. Done - now hold RMB to teleport (Rune metal also affect how fast you will teleport)<br><br><font size=\"16\" weight=\"bold\" lineheight=\"1.2\">Tips</font><br> - Snow will prevent you from teleportation - make sure you have roof abvoe your beacon.<br> - <font weight=\"bold\">Orange</font> particles - mean that teleportation position is blocked (maybe tree has grown, maybe there are chickens blocking your way :D)<br> - <font weight=\"bold\">Red</font> particles - mean that beacon was destroyed or moved to another position.<br> - You can replace beacon by another one made of different material, rune \"remembers\" teleportation coordinates, not exact beacon.",
